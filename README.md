- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JhuMamba
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games and data analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Trying to learn gameplay and engine design.

I always wanted to be a gameplay programmer but things are different in real world. Yeah I have a dream but will need to take care of an empty stomach of mine.
I have worked in many places even in car mechanic. It doesn't bother me actually, cause I like to do some engine thing and I think I'm born gifted to techs.

Life itself changed my way of learning.When I was a kid, I used to play with game functions and try to get some extra in-game money. This route brought me to a new type of
software which is called cheat-engine. Of course all of them was offline. After using cheat-engine, I discovered that I'm into this world where the only an array of characters
matter. Later I found a way of creating a game and this way is the OGRE 3D itself. I've tried to use OGRE but I was too little to understand things. Then I quit :D.

In one way or another, time has passed. After struggling with the codes, modules, libraries and the other things, I found a way to start my eternal torment. GAME ENGINES...
I'm not talking about creating a game with an engine. I'm talking about creating a game engine. Like proper game engine. Engine with every type of modules.
I know it's hard, maybe too much. But you know what, let's fuel the blaze of hell.
